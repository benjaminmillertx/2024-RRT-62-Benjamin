Benefits
Your landing page needs supporting copy beyond the headline to persuade most people. The key here is to describe specific benefits, along with features.
What is the difference? A feature is a specific quality of your product or service, while a benefit describes a positive impact that the feature has. (Here is a simple example: That lemonade that you are peddling may be ice cold, but it’s the fact that it keeps you cool on a hot day that is a benefit.)
Sometimes, you will hear people say you should write benefits, not features. If you are looking to drive more conversions, it is usually smart to show off features and benefits together — but lead with the benefit when you can.
 For example:
“Keep cool with an ice-cold Sunshine Lemonade.”
“You can create landing pages by yourself without help from a developer, using Unbounce’s drag-and-drop builder.”
4. Social Proof
Simply put, social proof is the influence that people around us have on the decisions we make. It is the reason why suddenly, everyone buys an Instant Pot, or why you might regret that WuTang Clan tattoo that Cindy talked you into.
On a landing page, social proof takes many forms:

Direct quotes from customers.
Case studies (or links to case studies).
Video interviews or testimonials.
Logos of customer companies.
Review scores from sites such as Yelp, Amazon, or Capterra.
Social proof is arguably the most powerful tool at your disposal, but there are two best practices to keep in mind.
First and foremost, you cannot fake it! If people smell a rat, you will have a hard time winning them back. Second, be specific. Whenever possible, give them the who, what, when, why, and how of your customers’ experience. A testimonial will be most effective if your prospect can identify with the person giving it.
PRO TIP: Be sure to make your testimonials a whole lot more convincing by including real customer names and photographs instead of stock photos and fake names.

5. A Conversion Goal (Your Call to Action)
Last but not least, a landing page should be focused on just one conversion goal — or else it is not a landing page (see the previous section). To your visitor, this is presented as a call-to-action (CTA), which can be either a standalone button on a clickthrough page or a form on a landing page designed for lead generation.
