Guided Lab - 303.13.1 - Reading a Delimited File
Introduction:
For separating a delimited file, we can use:
String class - has a split() method to identify the comma delimiter and split the row into fields.
Scanner class - has a useDelimiter() method to identify the comma delimiter and split the row into fields.
Objective:
In this Lab, we will demonstrate how to read a Delimited file by using Java. Below is one of the processes:
Create an object of type file. Set it to your fileâ€™s path, and then we will pass this file instance to the Scanner class for scanning. The Scanner class will read the file line-by-line.
Use the nextLine() method to read a line.
Split the file by delimiter by using String.split() method.
After the split, we can store data in ArrayList. We could store that line as a String[] array as shown below:
ArrayList<String[]>  
After that, for display, we can Iterate through Arraylist.
Learning Objective:
After this lab, learners will have demonstrated the ability to read a Delimited File using Java and using java methods.
Example 1
Click here to Download the Dummy file (Car.csv).
Remember the path or location of the downloaded file. We will use that file in this Lab.
Create a class named ScanDelimiterdFile, or give any name to the class. Write the code below in that class.
ðŸ’¡ Note: Do not forget to change the path or location of the file (cars.csv) at line number 9.
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class ScanDelimiterdFile{
   public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
           try {
               String location = "C:/Users/Downloads/cars.csv";
               File file = new File(location);
               Scanner input = new Scanner(file);
               ArrayList<String[]> data = new ArrayList<String[]>();
               while (input.hasNextLine()) {
                   String Line = input.nextLine();
                   String[] splitedLine = Line.split(",");
                   data.add(splitedLine);
               }
               for (String[] line : data) {
             //System.out.println(line[0] + "|" + line[1] + "|" + line[2] + "|" + line[3]  + line[4] + "|" + line[5] + "|" + line[6] + "|" + line[7] + "|" + line[8]);
                       System.out.println("Car Name :" + line[0] );
                       System.out.println("MPG :" + line[1] );
                       System.out.println("Cylinder :" + line[2] );
                       System.out.println("Displacement :" + line[3]);
                       System.out.println("Horsepower :" + line[4]);
                       System.out.println("Weight :" + line[5]);
                       System.out.println("Acceleration :" + line[6]);
                       System.out.println("Model :" + line[7]);
                       System.out.println("Origin :" + line[8]);
                       System.out.println("===============================");
                   }
           } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
               System.out.println("File not found! ");
               e.printStackTrace();
             
           }
       }
   }
