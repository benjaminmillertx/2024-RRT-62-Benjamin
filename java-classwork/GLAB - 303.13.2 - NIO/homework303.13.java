Run your program
After executing your program, a nioOutput.txt file will be created in your computer per the specified path location.
 
Example Two: Java NIO FileChannel transferTo() and transferFrom().
As in normal Java applications, where IO happens mostly between an input source and an output target, it happens in NIO as well, and we may need to transfer data from one channel to another channel frequently.
Bulk transfers of file data from one place to another are so common that a couple of optimization methods have been added to the FileChannel class to make it even more efficient.
Data Transfer between Channels
Java NIO provides two methods for transferring the data between two channels:
FileChannel.transferTo()
FileChannel.transferFrom()
The transferTo() and transferFrom() methods allow us to cross-connect one channel to another. This eliminates the need to pass the data through an intermediate buffer.
These methods exist only in the FileChannel class; therefore, one of the channels involved in a channel-to-channel transfer must be a FileChannel.
Create a class named NioExampleTwo and write the code below.
ðŸ’¡ Note: Do not forget to change the path location for both files,  file1.txt, and file2.txt.
